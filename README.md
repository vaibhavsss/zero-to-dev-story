# ðŸŒŒ zero-to-dev-story  

If youâ€™re reading this, it means youâ€™ve stepped into a space between silence and creation.  
A place where errors linger like shadows, and progress hums like distant static.  

This is my **13th repository**.  
Not an end, not a beginning â€” but a checkpoint on the way from nothing to becoming.

### ðŸŒ™ What youâ€™ll find here
Fragments of a journey:  
- Scratch work, fragile and unfinished  
- Projects in Django, Flask, Spring Boot, each a door left half-open  
- Reflections written at night, when code and thought blur together  
- Milestones that may seem small, but carry weight in their persistence

### ðŸŒ± Why it exists
Because growth is not loud.  
It is the quiet act of showing up â€” writing, breaking, fixing, learning.  

Each commit is not just code.  
It is a memory, a question, sometimes a regret, sometimes a revelation.  

And if you stay long enough, youâ€™ll see:  
This is not about reaching a final version.  
Itâ€™s about learning to live inside the process.

### ðŸŒŒ The voice of this repository
It does not ask for applause.  
It does not offer perfection.  
It only asks:  

Did you try today?  
Did you show up, even in silence?  
Did you turn struggle into a line of code, and error into a teacher?  

If the answer is yes, even once,  
then the story is still alive.

### ðŸŒ  Closing note
This is **zero-to-dev-story**.  
A fragile book of becoming, written commit by commit.  
Not to impress, but to exist.  
Not to end, but to continue.
